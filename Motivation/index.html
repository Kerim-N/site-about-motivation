        <h1>Motivation: The Driving Force Behind Our Actions</h1>
        <p>The term motivation describes why a person does something. It is the driving force behind human actions. Motivation is the process that initiates, guides, and maintains goal-oriented behaviors.</p>
        <p>For instance, motivation is what helps you lose extra weight, or pushes you to get that promotion at work. In short, motivation causes you to act in a way that gets you closer to your goals. Motivation includes the biological, emotional, social, and cognitive forces that activate human behavior.</p>
        <p>Motivation also involves factors that direct and maintain goal-directed actions. Although, such motives are rarely directly observable. As a result, we must often infer the reasons why people do the things that they do based on observable behaviors.</p>
        <p>Learn the types of motivation that exist and how we use them in our everyday lives. And if it feels like you've lost your motivation, do not worry. There are many ways to develop or improve your self-motivation levels.</p>
        <h2>What Are the Types of Motivation?</h2>
        <p>The two main types of motivation are frequently described as being either extrinsic or intrinsic.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Extrinsic motivation arises from outside of the individual and often involves external rewards such as trophies, money, social recognition, or praise.</li>
            <li>Intrinsic motivation is internal and arises from within the individual, such as doing a complicated crossword puzzle purely for the gratification of solving a problem.</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="fact">
          <h3>A Third Type of Motivation?</h3>
          <p>Some research suggests that there is a third type of motivation: family motivation.An example of this type is going to work when you are not motivated to do so internally (no intrinsic motivation), but because it is a means to support your family financially.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Why Motivation Is Important</h2>
        <p>Motivation serves as a guiding force for all human behavior. So, understanding how motivation works and the factors that may impact it can be important for several reasons.</p>
        <p>Understanding motivation can:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Increase your efficiency as you work toward your goals</li>
          <li>Drive you to take action</li>
          <li>Encourage you to engage in health-oriented behaviors</li>
          <li>Help you avoid unhealthy or maladaptive behaviors, such as risk-taking and addiction</li>
          <li>Help you feel more in control of your life</li>
          <li>Improve your overall well-being and happiness</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>What Are the 3 Components of Motivation?</h2>
        <p>If you've ever had a goal (like wanting to lose 20 pounds or run a marathon), you probably already know that simply having the desire to accomplish these things is not enough. You must also be able to persist through obstacles and have the endurance to keep going in spite of difficulties faced.</p>
        <p>These different elements or components are needed to get and stay motivated. Researchers have identified three major components of motivation: activation, persistence, and intensity.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Activation is the decision to initiate a behavior. An example of activation would be enrolling in psychology courses in order to earn your degree.</li>
          <li>Persistence is the continued effort toward a goal even though obstacles may exist. An example of persistence would be showing up for your psychology class even though you are tired from staying up late the night before.</li>
          <li>Intensity is the concentration and vigor that goes into pursuing a goal.For example, one student might coast by without much effort (minimal intensity) while another student studies regularly, participates in classroom discussions, and takes advantage of research opportunities outside of class (greater intensity).</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="fact leftBorder">
          <p>The degree of each of these components of motivation can impact whether you achieve your goal. Strong activation, for example, means that you are more likely to start pursuing a goal. Persistence and intensity will determine if you keep working toward that goal and how much effort you devote to reaching it.</p>
