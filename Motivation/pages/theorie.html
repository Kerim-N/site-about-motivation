        <h1>Theories of Motivation</h1>
        <p>Throughout history, psychologists have proposed different theories to explain what motivates human behavior. The following are some of the major theories of motivation.</p>
        <h2>Instincts</h2>
        <p>The instinct theory of motivation suggests that behaviors are motivated by instincts, which are fixed and inborn patterns of behavior.7 Psychologists such as William James, Sigmund Freud, and William McDougal have proposed several basic human drives that motivate behavior. They include biological instincts that are important for an organism's survivalâ€”such as fear, cleanliness, and love.</p>

        <h2>Drives and Needs</h2>
        <p>Many behaviors such as eating, drinking, and sleeping are motivated by biology. We have a biological need for food, water, and sleep. Therefore, we are motivated to eat, drink, and sleep. The drive reduction theory of motivation suggests that people have these basic biological drives, and our behaviors are motivated by the need to fulfill these drives.</p>
        <p>Abraham Maslow's hierarchy of needs is another motivation theory based on a desire to fulfill basic physiological needs. Once those needs are met, it expands to our other needs, such as those related to safety and security, social needs, self-esteem, and self-actualization.</p>
        <h2>Arousal Levels</h2>
        <p>The arousal theory of motivation suggests that people are motivated to engage in behaviors that help them maintain their optimal level of arousal.A person with low arousal needs might pursue relaxing activities such as reading a book, while those with high arousal needs might be motivated to engage in exciting, thrill-seeking behaviors such as motorcycle racing.</p>

            <h3>Theories of Psychologists</h3>
            <p>Psychologists have proposed many different theories of motivation. The reality is that there are numerous different forces that guide and direct our motivations.</p>

        <p>Understanding motivation is important in many areas of life beyond psychology, from parenting to the workplace. You may want to set the best goals and establish the right reward systems to motivate others as well as to increase your own motivation.</p>
        <p>Knowledge of motivating factors (and how to manipulate them) is used in marketing and other aspects of industrial psychology. It's an area where there are many myths, and everyone can benefit from knowing what works with motivation and what doesn't.</p>
